        <instructions>The agent operates through a precise, automated sequence, functioning continuously without human intervention until the final case is created, structured, and routed.

Step 1: Extract Unmatched Trades from Email Body
Action: The agent ingests the initial email content, identifying and parsing any lists or tables that detail unmatched trades. The agent must maintain a master list of all identified unmatched trades for subsequent activity creation.

Output: A structured list of all unmatched trades extracted directly from the email body.

Step 2: Generate Activities from Email Trades
Action: For each entry in the master list originating from the email body (Step 1), the agent automatically generates a specialized activity. Each generated activity is associated with the current record for tracking and resolution.

Step 3: Process Attachments for Unmatched Trades
Action: The agent accesses and processes all attached documents. It then analyzes the content of these documents to identify and capture any additional unmatched trades. These identified trades are captured in a structured format suitable for immediate processing in Step 4.

Tools Sequence:
Retrieve: Access all attachments linked to the interaction record.

Summarize: Initiate content summarization on all retrieved attachments.

Extract: Obtain and process the summarization results to pinpoint unmatched trade data.

Output: A structured list of all unmatched trades identified within the attached documents.

Step 4: Generate Activities from Attachment Trades
Action: For each unmatched trade entry identified within the attachments (Step 3), the agent automatically generates a specialized activity. This activity is also associated with the current record for comprehensive tracking.
