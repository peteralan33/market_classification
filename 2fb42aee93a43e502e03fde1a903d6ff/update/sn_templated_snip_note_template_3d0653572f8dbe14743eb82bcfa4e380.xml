<p>Subject: Summary of [Trade Date] Unmatched Trade Investigation Procedure</p>
<p>Dear [Recipient Name/Team Name],</p>
<p>This email summarizes the six-step process followed by the Operations team when investigating the unmatched trade involving [Security Name/Ticker] for the Trade Date of [Trade Date].</p>
<p>Our goal is to quickly identify the discrepancy, resolve the trade, and document the root cause for future prevention.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Investigation Steps:</h3>
<ul style="list-style-position: inside;">
<li>Identify and Log: We first recorded the core trade details (Security, Quantity, Price, Dates) and noted the reported reason for the unmatch to set the initial priority.</li>
<li>Verify Internally: Our team checked the internal booking system and the outgoing trade instruction/confirmation (e.g., SWIFT) to ensure our firm's records were accurate.</li>
<li>Contact Counterparty (CPTY): We communicated with [Counterparty Name] to determine the trade status on their side and obtained their specific details to isolate the exact point of discrepancy (e.g., Price, Quantity, Settlement Date).</li>
<li>Resolve Discrepancy: We agreed on the correct final trade details with the CPTY and executed the necessary corrective action (e.g., sending a corrected instruction).</li>
<li>Confirm Match: We verified that the corrective action successfully led to a match/affirmation in the relevant clearing or settlement utility.</li>
<li>Determine Root Cause: Finally, we documented the underlying reason for the error and are implementing preventative measures to stop its recurrence.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Status of Specific Trade (Optional):</p>
<ul style="list-style-position: inside;">
<li>Trade Reference: [Internal Trade ID]</li>
<li>Final Resolution: [e.g., Successfully Matched/Affirmed on T+1]</li>
<li>Root Cause Identified: [Briefly state the cause, e.g., Clerical error in quantity input.]</li>
</ul>
<p>Please let me know if you require a detailed log of the action taken for this specific trade.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
