        <description>Trade Reconciliation and Unmatched Trade Resolution&#13;
This business activity is the core post-trade process responsible for ensuring that the details of a securities transaction (a trade) executed between two parties—a buyer and a seller—are fully aligned and agreed upon before they can be sent for clearing and settlement.&#13;
&#13;
An unmatched trade (or "out trade") occurs when the trade details recorded by the two counterparties—the buy-side and the sell-side—do not agree. This prevents the transfer of cash and securities and halts the settlement process.&#13;
&#13;
Key Components of the Activity:&#13;
Data Comparison/Matching: The system or operations team compares key data elements of the trade from both parties' records. These elements include:&#13;
&#13;
Security Identifier (e.g., CUSIP, ISIN)&#13;
&#13;
Quantity (number of shares/bonds)&#13;
&#13;
Price and Total Consideration (money amount)&#13;
&#13;
Trade Date and Settlement Date&#13;
&#13;
Counterparty/Broker details&#13;
&#13;
Discrepancy Identification: If any critical data element differs, the trade is flagged as unmatched or mismatched.&#13;
&#13;
Investigation and Resolution (Break-Clearing): The Operations or Middle Office team immediately investigates the cause of the break. Common causes include:&#13;
&#13;
Manual data entry errors.&#13;
&#13;
Miscommunication between front and back offices.&#13;
&#13;
System failures or connectivity issues.&#13;
&#13;
Allocation errors (for block trades). The team contacts the counterparty to agree on the correct trade terms and input the necessary corrections (known as "fixing the break").&#13;
&#13;
Affirmation: Once both parties' records are updated and agree, the trade is formally affirmed (or "locked-in") and released to the clearing agent (like a Central Counterparty or CCP) for the final settlement process.&#13;
&#13;
The goal of this critical activity is to achieve the highest possible matching rate by the required regulatory deadlines (often by noon on T+1) to minimize operational risk, avoid failed trades, and prevent potential financial penalties or regulatory fines.</description>
