        <description>This statement is a common request in the financial services industry, particularly in the securities trading and settlement departments.&#13;
&#13;
Here is the breakdown of what it means:&#13;
&#13;
1. SSI stands for Standing Settlement Instructions&#13;
Definition: SSIs are the standard, default payment and delivery instructions for a financial entity (like a bank, investment manager, or fund). They specify where and how cash or securities should be sent for a particular type of trade.&#13;
&#13;
Analogy: You can think of SSIs as the "address" and "account number" for a firm to receive or send a specific asset.&#13;
&#13;
Components: A full SSI typically includes all the necessary details for settlement, such as:&#13;
&#13;
The Custodian Bank or Prime Broker&#13;
&#13;
The bank's SWIFT/BIC code (or routing number)&#13;
&#13;
The specific Account Number to credit/debit&#13;
&#13;
The Currency&#13;
&#13;
The Settlement Location (e.g., DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream)&#13;
&#13;
2. "Kindly provide the full SSI for the below trades."&#13;
Meaning: The person sending the message needs the complete and accurate details of the settlement accounts for the trades listed below the message (which you did not include).&#13;
&#13;
Why they need it:&#13;
&#13;
To Prevent Fails: Without the correct SSIs, the trade cannot be settled, leading to a "Failed Trade" and potential penalties (like the TMPG Fails Charge mentioned earlier).&#13;
&#13;
To Affirms Trades: The trade details, including the SSIs, must be matched and affirmed by both the buyer and the seller.&#13;
&#13;
To Initiate Payment: The instructions are needed to tell the custodian/clearing system exactly where to send the cash or securities.&#13;
&#13;
In simple terms, the team needs the "address book" information to correctly complete the transaction and ensure the money and securities get to the right place on the settlement date.</description>
